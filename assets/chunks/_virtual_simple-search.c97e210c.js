project structure Single Resource Unlike in FiveM or other platforms the Athena Framework runs out of a single resource using the alt V client Which means that there is no resource restarting Instead it s a full server restart You may think but that s really slow isn t it That s what I originally thought when I started writing this project but by using the most bleeding edge technologies we ve

VSCode https i imgur com pjHQuy2 png Server Structure Explained If you are planning on modifying these folders they are highly likely to be modified in the future If you want to expand upon the Framework consider using plugins api This folder contains the core API It s mostly only useful for adding new functions to the Athena API in groups athena There is a configuration file inside of here for customizing some of the core game mode s features It s currently being phased out but some configuration data is still present decorators All existing TypeScript based decorates for the framework effects These are the default item effects that come with the Athena Framework There isn t very many in here but enough information to build your own item effects events These are mostly event structures to help make Athena tick They should remain mostly untouched as there isn t much to customize here extensions This is where player functionality currently lives They can usually be accessed through Athena player x or Athena vehicle x inside of VSCode when writing functions Extensions can usually be modified with an override function to change the behavior and logic Which is accessible through the plugin structure as well imports This is where all core game mode imports are done These usually consist of many different imports with a load order to ensure the game mode runs correctly You may append any additional core import files here However it is highly recommended to use the plugin structure instead for modifying adding new features to the framework creating plugins md plugins creating plugins md interface These are server side specific interfaces which help define different type structures in the framework You can find account structure category information configs etc in here Usually you don t want to directly modify these but instead extend them You can find examples of extensions of common interfaces inside of some of the plugins in the src core plugins folder streamers These help synchronize server and client specific information using a custom node based streamer that runs along side the Athena Framework The streamer basically takes in player information determines the closest set of data around that player then feeds it to the player s client side In most cases all major streamers are covered such as objects markers static pedestrians text labels etc These can be accessed under Athena controllers x systems This is a huge portion of the logic for the framework This is where a lot of core functionality can be found Everything from sound systems character systems blip systems chat systems storage systems can all be found here This also contains injections which can be accessed through Athena injections Injections will let you override or modify existing features without touching the core too much The catch is that the functionality in most of this section is abstracted to be used or called from other interfaces such as WebViews Views

Well in most cases Athena is constantly moving forward with security patches algorithm improvements and new features There is often a dedicated development branch that Stuyk and the community are constantly pushing changes into If you do not update you run the risk of your game mode becoming out of date and unmanageable in the foreseeable future x20 Want evidence of this As the author of Athena I ve witnessed my old game mode become completely unplayable after 6 months time of not updating Too many features have become out of date and API changes have made it near impossible to update So what does the author recommend Stay up to date or risk the game mode breaking Learn these tools you will not regret it How do I Update When you cloned your private fork of the Athena Framework you should have ran this in a terminal git remote add upstream https github com Stuyk altv athena git remote set url push upstream DISABLE After running this in a terminal you are now hooked up to the main repository to pull updates from You will first need to commit any changes that you have made on your private fork git add git commit m I made some changes this is what I did here git push origin

them into your current repository Merging from Master git fetch upstream git pull upstream master Merging from a Development Branch git fetch upstream git pull upstream branch version goes here Now I Have Merge Conflicts Yes you should normally have merge conflicts This is the part where you absolutely must learn the tools that you are using Merge conflicts means there is a difference between your current repository and the other repository which you pulled code from This means you will be fixing merge conflicts by using VSCode to help identify and fix them You will need to figure out where all

will only contain your changes if you know how utilize git Which is a tool used for pushing changes to repositories As I ve stated dozens of times If you are not familiar with these tools you will have a hard time working with them Athena Framework will move forward without you and if you do not learn to use these tools your server will struggle with security updates Do I need to buy a server In most cases NO You do not need to buy a server Your local machine will work just fine until you decide you want to add more users to your server x20 When you are launching for a full community you
